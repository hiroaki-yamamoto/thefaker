# Fake file

## What's this?
This is very simple **ruby** code disguised as Python code

## What!? Why did you do so!?
I'm using a certain web service to seek jobs, and it has a feature to find what
language the job seeker can write, but I suppose they made it in a very rough
way and I'm trying to crack it.

## The result
As the result, the service seems to be identifying coding languages by the
extensions of the files.
